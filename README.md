## Java Machine test - Nimap Task Using Springboot Framework, Annotation based configuration, DB configuration, JPA and Lombok Library.

### Details : 
              Firstly created springboot project then in that add the depedencies like SpringBoot Web, SpringBoot Devtools, SpringBoot Actuator, MySQL Driver, Spring Data JPA
              and Lombok Library.
              After that in application.properties file add database configuration.
              
              In this project I created entity class i.e Category for data handling. After that created controller i.e CategoryController for creating api. After that created 
              service class i.e CategoryService for write business logic. Then I created dao class i.e CategoryDao for writing the database logic. 
              In controller class created api for :
                                                    1.  Create api for Add Category.
                                                    2.  Create api for Get All Category.
                                                    3.  Create api for Get Perticular Record of Category.
                                                    4.  Create api for Update Category.
                                                    5.  Create api for Delete Category.                                            

              Then using Lombok Library created entity class i.e Product.
              Lombok Library automatically generate the getter setter method, toString method, argument constructor, no argument constructor using annotation like 
              @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor.
              After that created controller i.e ProductController for creating api. then created service class i.e ProductService for write business logic. Then I created 
              dao class i.e ProductDao for writing the database logic.
              After that in controller class created api for :
                                                              1. Create api for Add Product.
                                                              2. Create api for Get All Records of Product.
                                                              3. Create api for Get Perticular Record of Product.
                                                              4. Create api for Update Product.
                                                              5. Create api for Delete Product.
